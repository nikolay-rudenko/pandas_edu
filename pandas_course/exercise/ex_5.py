# Assume the pandas library has already been imported and assigned an alias of 'pd'.
# Let's say I have a DataFrame that looks like this:
#
#     A	  B	  C	  D	  E
#  0  7	  8	  9	  7	  5
#  1  7	  5	  3	  6	  9
#  2  3	  8	  8	  4	  4
#
# The DataFrame has been assigned to the variable "df"


# Write the code to extract the "C" column from the DataFrame.
